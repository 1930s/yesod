# Contributor Code of Conduct

Always be nice. When communicating online treat people the way you would if
they were standing next to you. The project maintainers have the right and
responsibility to maintain that standard of niceness, and you should contact
them if it is not upheld.  Don't forget to be nice whenever representing the
project to others outside the project.  If you are not nice, apologize.
